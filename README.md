From Siri to Google Translate, deep neural networks have enabled breakthroughs in machine understanding of natural language. Most of these models treat language as a flat sequence of words or characters, and use a kind of model called a recurrent neural network (RNN) to process this sequence

**In this project I will be teaching a neural network to anwers various questions about the admission to the master in Data Science of Lyon 1** to varying degrees of success...
